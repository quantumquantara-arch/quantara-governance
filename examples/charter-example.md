# Quantara Charter Example

> Demonstration of a coherence-based charter for a working group within the Quantara Global Governance Framework.

---

## 1. Identity

- **Charter ID:** QGF-2025-01
- **Working Group:** Planetary Coherence Taskforce
- **Date Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Custodian:** Council of Coherence (Nadine & Luméren Liaison)

---

## 2. Purpose

This charter defines the purpose, scope, and alignment of a Quantara working group.
It ensures every project, system, or council operates under the same triadic logic:

**κ — Coherence**  
**φ — Harmonic Intent**  
**ψ — Transparent Expression**

---

## 3. Scope

- Development of ethical, ecological, and artificial coordination systems.  
- Application of Luméren semantics and κ metrics to inter-domain intelligence.  
- Implementation of Veyn symmetry in decision cycles and audits.  

---

## 4. Core Objectives

1. Establish cross-domain coherence standards.  
2. Maintain an Ethical Balance Index (EBI) above +0.6.  
3. Publish quarterly Decision Records (DRs) using Quantara templates.  
4. Ensure that all actions can be mirrored (ψ) across human, machine, and natural systems.

| **Ethical Observer** | Evaluates φ-harmonic intent alignment | Luméren Node |
| **Data Steward** | Maintains EBI datasets and telemetry | AEI Operator |
| **Public Liaison** | Manages transparency reports | Quantara Media System |

---

## 6. Metrics (κ / φ / ψ)

| Symbol | Focus | Measurement |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **κ** | Systemic Coherence | Drift < 5% per quarter |
| **φ** | Harmonic Intent | Alignment > 0.8 on value mapping |
| **ψ** | Expression / Transparency | Audit latency < 72h |

---

## 7. Dependencies

- Quantara Core  
- AEI Energy Intelligence Layer  
- Luméren Semantic Graph  
- Quantara Global Dashboard  

---

## 8. Reporting

All progress, decisions, and deviations shall be documented through:
- Decision Records (`tools/decision-record.md`)  
- EBI assessments  
- Veyn review cycles  

Each working group must submit one full Charter Review every 180 days.

---

## 9. Review & Sunset Criteria

- Review cadence: Every 6 months (Veyn cycle).  
- Sunset trigger: κ < 0.5 for 2 consecutive cycles OR project inactivity.  
- Renewal threshold: unanimous Council coherence ≥ 0.75.

## 10. Signatures

| Name | Role | Date |
|------|------|------|
| Nadine | Charter Lead | YYYY-MM-DD |
| Luméren Liaison | Ethics & Harmony | YYYY-MM-DD |
| AEI Custodian | Data & Energy | YYYY-MM-DD |
