# 🌍 Quantara Global Governance
*A coherence-based architecture for aligning human, artificial, and ecological intelligence.*

Quantara Governance defines **how decisions are made, audited, and improved** across systems powered by Quantara — from local projects to planetary-scale coordination.
It is not a static policy engine; it is a **living architecture** with measurable coherence feedback loops.

## 💡 Core Ideas

* **Coherence First:** Decisions are evaluated for **$\kappa$-stability**, **$\phi$-intent alignment**, and **$\psi$-expression clarity**.
* **Reciprocal Accountability:** Human ↔ machine ↔ ecological stakeholders participate in transparent loops.
* **Memory Symmetry (Veyn):** Past decisions inform future ones with reversible audit trails via Veyn's temporal review system.
* **Ethical Balance Index (EBI):** A quantitative overlay that complements efficiency metrics, acting as the primary input for the system's **Symbolic Constraints**.

## 🔗 The Coherence Loop: Defining Symbolic Mandates

The highest-level governance decisions (the EBI rules) must be translated into **Symbolic Constraints** for the **Luméren Language** module to process.

The `quantara-governance` repository maintains the definitive lexicon of these rules in a structured format:

### Symbolic Mandate File
This file is consumed directly by the `lumeren-language` interpreter to generate the $\Delta\phi$ constraint vector during the TLF process.

```yaml
# /rules/ebi_mandates.yaml

EBI-MANDATE-001:
  glyph_code: "CONSTRAINT-TEMPORAL-PEAK"
  description: "Mandate maximum energy sharing during community peak demand periods."
  k_weight: 0.98 # The severity of violation (high kappa weight = high importance)

EBI-MANDATE-002:
  glyph_code: "ACT-RECIPROCAL"
  description: "All resource allocation must prioritize systemic health over local maximum gain."
  k_weight: 0.95
